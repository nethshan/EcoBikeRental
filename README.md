## Getting Started
1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `HomePage.html` in your preferred web browser to view the homepage.
3. Make sure all folders (`css`, `js`, and `img`) are in the same directory as the HTML file for the correct loading of resources.

No server-side setup is required; the application runs fully on the frontend.

## Usage
- **Navigation:** Use `HomePage.html` as your entry point.
- **Admin & Management:** Access dashboards and manage rentals through links/buttons provided in the UI.
- **Customization:**
  - Edit styles in `stylesheet.css` or files in `css/`.
  - Update or add JavaScript functionality in the `js/` directory.
  - Add or replace images for bikes and backgrounds in the `img/` folder.

## Credits
- Images and icons: Check the `/img/` folder for attributions or licenses, if any.
- Developed as part of a web design and development course project.
